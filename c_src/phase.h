    //! Array to all store information about the polymer architecture.
    //!
    //! \warning The useage of this array is \a not straight forward. Please read the doc carefully.
    //!
    //! The array contains three different information about the polymer architecture.
    //!  - The number of monomers per polymer. This information is always located at poly_arch[poly_type_offset[poly_type]].
    //!    You can read this information directly:
    //!    \code const unsigned int N = poly_arch[poly_type_offset[poly_type]]; \endcode
    //!    Writing is not recomeneded.
    //!  - The information about the bonded neighbours is stored in a so called bond_offset_lists.<br>
    //!    The second info tells you, where you find the start of such a
    //!    list for your monomer of interest. We might call this the
    //!    Monomer region. And it contains the offset to the bond list
    //!    as well as the Monomer type.
    //!    \note The Monomer region starts for a polymer_type at:
    //!    \code poly_type_offset[poly_type] +1 \endcode
    //!
    //!    So to find the index where to start reading the bond list you do:
    //!    \code
    //!    const unsigned int start = get_bondlist_offset(
    //!                                  p->poly_arch[poly_type_offset[poly_type] + mono_index + 1] );
    //!    \endcode
    //!    If this start is < 0 the meaning is that the corresponding
    //!    Monomer has no bonded neigbours.<br>
    //!    The other information is the particle type of your monomer of interest.
    //!    You can access this information with the following snippet:
    //!    \code
    //!    const unsigned int type = get_particle_type(
    //!                                 p->poly_arch[poly_type_offset[poly_type] + mono_index + 1] );
    //!    \endcode
    //!    If you want to create an element of the monomer region in
    //!    poly_arch, you can call get_info_bl().
    //!  - The final information is the actual bondlist. Each element of
    //!    the bond list region carries 3 bits of information.
    //!    - The first is the \a end flag, which tells you wheter this
    //!    is last element in the bond list. You can access the ith element of your bondlist via:
    //!    \code const unsigned int end = get_end( p->poly_arch[ start + i] );\endcode
    //!    - The second is the \a offset tells you the offset you apply
    //!    to your monomer index to obtain the neighbour index. (intentional int!)
    //!    \code const int offset = get_offset( p->poly_arch[ start + i]); \endcode
    //!    - The last info is the bond type of the corresponding bond.
    //!    \code const unsigned int bond_type = get_bond_type( p->poly_arch[start + i] );\endcode
    //! To see, how you can iterate all bonds of a specific monomer, you
    //! can see in the following example:
    //! \code
    //! const int start = get_bondlist_offset(
    //!             p->poly_arch[p->poly_type_offset[p->polymers[ipoly].type] + ibead + 1]);
    //! const unsigned int mono_type = get_particle_type(p->poly_arch[
    //!                             p->poly_type_offset[p->polymers[ipoly].type] + ibead +1]);
    //! if(start > 0){
    //!   int i = start;
    //!   unsigned int end;
    //!   do{
    //!     const uint32_t info = p->poly_arch[i++];
    //!     end = get_end( info );
    //!     const unsigned int bond_type = get_bond_type(info);
    //!     const int offset = get_offset( info);
    //!     const unsigned int neighbour_id = ibead + offset;

    //!                             p->poly_type_offset[p->polymers[ipoly].type] + neighbour_id +1]);
    //!     const unsigned int jbead = neighbour_id;
