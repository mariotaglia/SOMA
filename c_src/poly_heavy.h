/*!
  Struct to combine all heavy data pointer for the polymers of this rank.
  Each individual polymer contains offset values that clarify which area of the memory belongs to the respective polymer.
  It is important to ensure that these areas are initialised to not overlap.

  Advantage of these large memory blocks, instead of small pointer for each polymers is, that they can be more easily allocated and transferred to GPUs and/or other ranks.
  The use of offset integer, instead of pointers, referring to the large memory block is, that we can avoid any kind of deep-copy issues with OpenACC.

  Pointers that are not used, because the current execution mode doesn't need them are set to NULL.
