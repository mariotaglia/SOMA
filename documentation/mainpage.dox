 \section intro_sec Introduction

 This is the documentation of SOMA it is intended to help to use the
 program. In addition it provides a documentation of the functionality
 of the code. So for developer working with SOMA this is a good
 starting point for anything. If you have nothing developed for SOMA
 before, please read our \ref design page first.

 \subsection Theoretical Background

  The program performs a single-chain in mean-field simulation. For
  further details look for the publication: <a
  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2364506"> "Single chain in mean
  field simulations: Quasi-instantaneous field approximation and
  quantitative comparison with Monte Carlo simulations", Daoulas,
  Kostas Ch. and MÃ¼ller, Marcus , J. Chem.Phys.2006, Volume 125,
  Number 18. </a> <br> For details how this model is implemented in
  SOMA refer also the \ref theory page.

\subsection Detailed Description
 The following list provides an overview about SOMA group in separate aspects.

 - \ref workflow Summary how to productively use the program if no new features are needed.
 - \ref input Explanation of the XML input files.
 - \ref features List of all implemented features and an explanation how to use them.
 - \ref install Introduction to get SOMA running on Linux systems.
 - \ref theory Introduction of the implementation of before mentioned model in SOMA.
 - \ref design Guidelines and comments about the code of SOMA.
 - \ref hdf5 All data for SOMA is stored using the hdf5 data format. This introduction helps to get started.
 - \ref prng_gen Gives you Background information about the pseudo random number generators which are used
 - \ref plugin Help page for writing plugins for SOMA.
