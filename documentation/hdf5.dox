/*!\page hdf5 The HDF5 File-Format

The HDF5 file format is one of the key features you will need to perform simulations with SOMA on a HPC Cluster.
The HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. In our case it will guarantee a well optimized
real parallel IO. It means every MPI process writes at the same time to a previous defined data container exclusively.
If you want to know how to compile with hdf5: \ref HDF5.

\section hdf5edit2 How to edit a hdf5 file

To edit a hdf5 file you can follow different strategies.
In a terminal you can use h5dump to dump data out of your file.
If you prefer a visual tool you can use hdfviewer as well but therefore an X server is required which can become
difficult in some cluster environments. The most gently way to deal with hdf5 files from our point of view is the usage of python (import h5py).
To get an idea how to perform with python you can go for our handleAnaH5.py example.

- <a href="http://docs.h5py.org/">  python module </a>: import h5py, most flexible but has to installed
- <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/Tools.html#Tools-Dump/">h5dump </a>, more or less always available first step to check specific observables
- <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/">hdfviewer </a>, visual environment with simple statistical analysis included.
