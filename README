SOMA: Soma Offers Monte Carlo Acceleration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOMA is a software package, which offers High Performance Computing Monte-Carlo
simulations of the "Single Chain in Mean Field" model for soft coarse grained
polymers.
The paper for this model is:
  Daoulas, Kostas Ch. and Müller, Marcus , J. Chem.Phys.2006, 125,18

This version is a short introduction for more details refer the doxygen
documentation.

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- CMake
- c99 compiler*
- MPI
- MPI IO
- parallel HDF5
- h5py**
- doxygen***

*) SOMA  is tested with GCC and PGI compilers. The latter is required for GPU
accelerated versions via OpenACC.
**) The h5py package is not required to build, install or run SOMA, but to
prepare input files.
***) Doxygen is only required to build the documentation.

Install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SOMA is designed for the out of source compilation using CMake. So CMake is
 required to build SOMA. This section will step by step guide you to build and
 install SOMA.

 * Git checkout your desired branch our tag of SOMA. Suggested is the latest
   tag or the "master" branch.

  git checkout master

* Create your build directory. And enter it.

  mkdir build
  cd build

* Configure CMake. This step depends on the type of build:
  * If you want a standard build with your standard compiler and you have system
    wide installed parallel hdf5.

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/SOMAinstall ../

  * If you want to use a specific compiler, for example "pgcc"
    set it up for CMake.

     export CC=my_compiler
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/SOMAinstall ../

  * If you are not using a system wide HDF5 installation set
    the "HDF5_ROOT" variable.

     HDF5_ROOT=/path/to/hdf5install \
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/SOMAinstall ../

     It is important that the path is HDF5_ROOT is absolute.
     Sometimes problems occur and the wrong library of hdf5 is found.
     Try to guide cmake appropriately.

  * Now you can easily modify the options of SOMA build using

    ccmake .

  * Build SOMA:

    make

  * Test your compilation result:

    make test

    This may take some time.

  * Install SOMA:

    make install

  Now you find the SOMA executables at "/path/to/SOMAinstall/bin" and if you
  haven't deactivated the installation of the python scripts you can find them
  at "/path/to/SOMAinstall/python-script".
  You may want to set your PATH accordingly.

  * Compiling the Documentation:

  To compile the documentation you need doxygen and then can run in the
  build directory

   make doc

  As a result, you find a html and a latex documentation in the
  "documentation" folder.

  For builds on commonly used clusters try, if you find an appropriate
  file in "setups".

Example Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example input files can be found in the example directory.

 * Create yourself an HDF5 input configuration:

   python ConfGen.py -i coord.xml

 * This creates two files:
    * "coord.h5" with the simulation configuration.   
    * "coord_ana.h5" with the analysis description, where the
      observables are stored.

 * Now you can finally run your simulation by using

    mpiexec -n [N] ./SOMA -c coord.h5 -a coord_ana.h5 -t #steps [options]

    Also run "./SOMA --help" for more options, especially if you want
    to run with GPU or OpenMP support.

 * The final configuration is saved in the file "end.h5". The final analyzed
   observables are saved in your input ana file.
