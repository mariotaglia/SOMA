Change log of the development of SOMA.
Please add your contributions.

v0.8.0 22/03/26
    * Reaction now allow for a rate, and 
      an arbitrary number of density 
      dependencies                      Gregor Ibbeken
    * Option ENABLE_MONOTYPE_CONVERSION
      to allow same reactions for monomer
      types and blocks of monomers      Gregor Ibbeken
    
	BUGFIXES

    * fix problem where polyconversion 
      didnt work with domain decomposition
      or with OpenMP.                               GI
    * fix bug for use of multiple conversions       GI

v0.7.0 21/12/11
	* allow or mobility modifications.
	  tanh and muller-smith LS
	* Enable self documentation features	        LS
	* Reactions. The user defines zones, where
	one polymer type is converted into another. 	LS
	* CMake python. Identify suitable python
	environment via CMake				LS
	* implement density dependent mobility          LS
	* assign each polymer a unique tag
	  the tag remains constant between runs         LS
	* Enabling CUDA aware MPI and NCCL              LS
	* Enabling different MC frequency for poly_types LS

	BUGFIXES

	* fix problem with exact area51 genration
	of polymers and its test.        		MM and LS
	* enable extra SOMA_C_FLAGS as
	environment added to C_FLAGS	 LS
	* fix problem with calculation of the
	bond-anisotropy for closed chains, while
	using minimum image convention.			Leon Frangen
	* fix problem of unintentionally updating
	with the polyarch with reorderd poly IDs
	and ConfGen.py --update
	WARNING: new default: no update of polyarch 	LS
	* implement weighting of
	different monomer types
	<density_weight> 		 LS

v0.6.1 23/1/19
	* fix a problem with memory management for
	  structure factors		LS
	* fix bug with version or help output LS
	* license update 2019		LS
	* reduce runtime of domain	LS
	  statistics test

v0.6.0 19/12/18

	* A second option for independent
	  sets calculation FIXED-N-SETS
	  (suitable for networks)       Gaoyuan Wang
	* Implemenation of an umbrella
	  field for advanced sampling   Niklas Blagojevic
	  techniques.                   Ludwig Schneider
	* Domain decomposition as
	  another parallel layer for
	  large system sizes.           Ludwig Schneider
	* The option to calculated the
	  bond energy and bond force with
	  minmum image convention is
	  added                         Gaoyuan Wang
	  (MIC needs to be compiled and
	  runned with MIC flag)
	* Separation of ConfGen and     Gaoyuan Wang
	  AnaGen
	* The rng_state is changed from
	  automatic update to update
	  under requirement             Gaoyuan Wang
	* Async is used to run long
	  chains and short chains in
	  parallel on several kernels   Gaoyuan Wang
	* Calculation of dynamical
	  and static structure factors  Gaoyuan Wang
	* Time dependent external
	  potential is added            Gaoyuan Wang
        * User option to specify an     LS
	  output file.
	* compatibilty with PGI 18.7    LS
	* Environment to manage wall    LS
	  time options. See doc for
	  details
	* Force an indention style      LS

	remove:
	* signal management             LS

	v0.5.2 05/11/18
